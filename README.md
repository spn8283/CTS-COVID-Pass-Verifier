  2. After register you will received and email which gives you client_id, client_secret and url.

  3. You need to setup config file as below.

    client_id = #Client id from MATTR apis

    client_secret = #Client Secret for MATTR api

    url = #Tenet URL after register new tenet under MATTR account

  4.  after setup config file need to restart raspberry pi using the below command 

    sudo reboot
