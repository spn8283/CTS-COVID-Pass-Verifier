  Configure two relay board.

    1. Connect 5V power pin(number 2 pin from the image 2) to power pin on relay board(VCC).

    2. Pass Verified - Connect GPIO 17 pin(number 11 pin from the image 2) to input pin on board (IN1).

    3. Pass Not Verified - Connect GPIO 18 pin(number 12 pin from the image 2) to input pin on board(IN2).

    4. Ground - connect ground pin (number 6 pin from the image 2) to ground pin the relay board(GND).
